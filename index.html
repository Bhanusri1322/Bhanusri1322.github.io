            <h3>Project Title 1</h3>
            <p><b>Basic E-Commerce Website</b>
                This is a simple e-commerce website where users can browse products, view details, and add items to their shopping cart. It features a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The shopping cart updates in real-time as items are added or removed, and there's a checkout form with basic validation to ensure all fields are filled out correctly.
                
                This project helped me practice front-end skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            <p><b>
                Hybrid MIMO Detection Algorithm</b></p>
This project is about developing a hybrid algorithm for detecting signals in Large MIMO systems, which are used in modern wireless communications. The goal is to make signal detection faster and more efficient while keeping the complexity low.

I combined an optimization technique called IAMMPSO (Improved Adaptive Multi-Population Particle Swarm Optimization) with traditional MIMO detection methods. This approach improves both speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications.
